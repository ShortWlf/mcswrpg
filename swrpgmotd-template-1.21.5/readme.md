Swrpgmotd is a Minecraft mod designed to enhance server communication by automatically displaying a Message of the Day (MOTD) when players join. It retrieves the MOTD from a configurable JSON file (config/swrpgmotd.json), which allows server administrators to customize the welcome message and include a clickable link to external resources like a wiki. The mod sends the MOTD using a tellraw command, ensuring formatted text with a blue-underlined clickable link for players. Additionally, Swrpgmotd provides two key commands: /motd reload to update the configuration dynamically and /motd show to display the current MOTD manually. The mod ensures seamless integration with Fabric API, automatically creating a default configuration if none exists, and includes fallback text messaging in case command execution fails.
