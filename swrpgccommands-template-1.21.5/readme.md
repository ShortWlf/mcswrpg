Swrpgccommands is a Minecraft mod designed for server administrators to manage and execute custom commands efficiently. It allows the creation of new commands via a configuration file, enabling automated actions such as teleportation, messaging, and weather control. The mod supports permission-based command execution, restricting certain actions to server operators while allowing others to be freely used by all players. Additionally, Swrpgccommands includes built-in utility commands, such as /coords for displaying player coordinates and /swrrefresh for reloading custom commands dynamically. Through structured JSON configurations, administrators can define and modify commands without needing direct code edits, making server management more streamlined and flexible.
