Swrpglevels is a Minecraft RPG progression mod that introduces an experience-based leveling system for various in-game activities. It tracks XP progression across skills such as agility, woodcutting, farming, harvesting, fishing, crafting, mining, cooking, smithing, alchemy, enchanting, and combat, awarding experience points based on actions performed by players. The mod dynamically calculates skill levels using a formula-driven leveling system, allowing customizable XP rates and thresholds through configuration files.

The mod features event-driven XP rewards, granting experience for specific interactions like:

Breaking blocks (woodcutting, mining, harvesting)

Crafting items (crafting XP)

Cooking food (cooking XP)

Fishing mechanics (fishing XP)

Smithing and enchanting (custom XP tracking)

Combat encounters (tracking hostile mobs and awarding XP for eliminations)

The mod also integrates player stats tracking, maintaining persistent experience data per player UUID, and enables configuration through skill_config.json. Additionally, administrators can reload configuration files dynamically using /swrpgrefresh and check personal XP status using /stats.
