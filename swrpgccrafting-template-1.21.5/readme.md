Swrpgccrafting is a Minecraft mod that automates the generation and management of datapacks containing custom recipes and advancements. It processes a configuration file (config/swrpgccrafting.json) to define crafting recipes, recipe unlock advancements, and datapack presets. Recipes are structured with customizable crafting grids, ingredient keys, and output items. The mod writes these recipes to designated folders, ensuring proper integration within Minecraft's crafting system. Additionally, advancements are generated for base datapack recipes, enabling in-game recipe unlock tracking. Swrpgccrafting maintains a synchronized datapack folder by automatically removing obsolete recipe and advancement files that are not listed in the configuration. This ensures efficient organization and a structured approach to custom recipe integration.
