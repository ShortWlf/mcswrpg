Seopcmdoveride is a Minecraft server security and moderation mod designed to manage operator (OP) permissions and prevent unauthorized command execution. It ensures that players with non-local IP addresses cannot retain OP status, automatically de-opping and disconnecting them if necessary. The mod overrides potentially dangerous commands (such as /ban, /kick, /op, /gamemode, etc.), restricting their usage based on server configuration. Additionally, it forces all players into Survival mode upon joining and continuously verifies that their gamemode remains unchanged during server ticks. The mod also supports configurable IP whitelisting, allowing exceptions for trusted local connections.
