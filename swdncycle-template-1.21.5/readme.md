Swdncycle is a Minecraft mod that customizes the day-night cycle by allowing server administrators to set specific durations for day and night. It overrides the default time progression by locking daylight cycles, ensuring a controlled transition between day and night. The mod supports configuration through a settings file, where users can define custom durations for day and night in minutes. During the night cycle, the mod broadcasts a warning message to players before transitioning. Additionally, Swdncycle implements a debug mode to log transitions and time adjustments, assisting administrators in monitoring server behavior.
