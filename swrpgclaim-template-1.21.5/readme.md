SWRPGClaim is a Minecraft mod designed to provide a structured land-claim system, allowing players to define and protect their own regions. The mod enables players to claim a flat area centered around their position using /claimarea, with customizable claim sizes set by administrators. Once claimed, only the owner can modify blocks unless edit mode is enabled, allowing full access to all players. The mod also protects against unauthorized block placements and interactions with important objects like chests, doors, and beds, ensuring claims remain secure.

Additionally, SWRPGClaim features extensive admin tools, including /addclaimplayer to register players, /setclaimsize to modify claim dimensions, and /removeclaimadmin to clear a player's claim. Players can personalize their claimed area by assigning custom names with /setclaimname, teleporting to their claim with /tpc, and toggling permissions like object interaction (/swclaimuse) and claim expansion (/extendclaim). The mod uses a server tick system to notify players when entering a claimed region, reinforcing awareness of land ownership.
