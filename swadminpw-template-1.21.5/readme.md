Swadminpw is a Minecraft server authentication and access control mod that enhances security by requiring players to verify their identity upon joining. The mod enforces authentication by validating usernames against a predefined password list, disconnecting unauthorized players, and maintaining an allowlist of trusted users. Players required to authenticate must use the /auth <password> command within a set time limit, after which they are disconnected if verification fails. The mod also manages a configurable authentication timeout and logs unauthorized join attempts. Additionally, Swadminpw integrates configuration files for easy management of allowed players and authentication settings.
