Swrpgbackup is a Minecraft server backup automation mod that ensures regular and incremental world saves with minimal storage impact. The mod automatically creates hourly and daily backups, maintaining a rotating set of recent saves to prevent excessive disk usage. Manual backups can also be triggered via the /backup command, and a final save is performed upon server shutdown. It uses an incremental backup system, linking unchanged files from previous saves to conserve space, and implements configurable retention limits to delete old backups beyond a set threshold. With robust error handling and logging, Swrpgbackup provides reliable, efficient, and non-disruptive world data protection.
