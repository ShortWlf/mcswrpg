Swloottext is a Minecraft mod that enhances item visibility and categorization by dynamically applying color-coded rarity labels to dropped items. It assigns rarity levels—such as common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary, and mythic—based on customizable configurations stored in a JSON file. The mod automatically updates item names in the world with appropriate formatting, making loot recognition intuitive. Players within a set proximity can see items with their rarity color-coded and quantity displayed. Additionally, Swloottext offers debug logging to assist administrators in monitoring rarity assignments and item recognition behavior.
