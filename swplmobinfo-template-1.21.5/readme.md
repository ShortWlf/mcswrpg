Swplmobinfo is a Minecraft mod that enhances mob visibility and information display by dynamically assigning custom names based on health, level, and aggression type. It tracks nearby mobs and applies formatted names, showing health points and levels while maintaining player-applied name tags. The mod distinguishes between hostile, peaceful, and boss-type mobs using color-coded formatting, ensuring clear identification. It leverages configuration settings to define display distances for mod-generated and name-tagged custom names while seamlessly integrating with existing entity behaviors. Additionally, Swplmobinfo maintains cached mob data to optimize performance and prevent unnecessary updates, ensuring a smooth gameplay experience.
